## 🙋‍♂️ FAQ

### How do I get my Twitch API credentials?

You can get your Twitch API credentials by creating a new application on
the [Twitch Developer Portal](https://dev.twitch.tv/).
Get your ClientID and Client Secret from the application's dashboard.
After that, you can install [TwitchCLI](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/cli/) and run the following command to get your
access token:

```sh
twitch token -u -s "user:edit user:read:email chat:read chat:edit channel:moderate moderation:read moderator:manage:shoutouts moderator:manage:announcements channel:manage:moderators channel:manage:broadcast channel:read:vips channel:read:subscriptions channel:manage:vips"
```

You will receive a user access token and a refresh token, add them to your `.env` file.

### What's `server.crt` and `server.key` files?

These files are used to run the webserver in HTTPS. If you want to use HTTPS, you can generate these files using OpenSSL
or
other tools. If you don't want to use HTTPS, you can remove the `server.crt` and `server.key` in `server/server.ts`.

### I couldn't install Bun in my system

Currently, Bun is only available for Linux and MacOS. If you are using Windows, you can use WSL or a virtual machine to
run the project.
For the WSL installation, you can follow
the [official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
